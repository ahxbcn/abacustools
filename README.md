Collection of tools used for performing DFT calculation with ABACUS.

## Command-line subcommands

Subcommands are registered in the package with Python's
`argparse.add_subparsers()`. The top-level command provides `version` and
nested `file` subcommands:

```text
abacustools version
abacustools file input INPUT
abacustools file stru STRU
abacustools file kpt KPT
```

Both the top-level parser and each subcommand provide their own help text:

```text
abacustools --help
abacustools file --help
abacustools file input --help
```

Calculation results can be collected from one or more completed ABACUS jobs:

```text
abacustools postprocess result -j JOB -p energy force stress
```

Use `abacustools postprocess result --help` to see all supported result
parameters. If `--param` is omitted, the command selects the results relevant
to the job's calculation type and displays scalar results as compact,
borderless tables. If the result columns do not fit the terminal, they are
split into multiple tables with repeated headers rather than being truncated
or wrapped by the terminal. A result that does not apply to a job is shown as
`-`. Large array results such as `force` and `stress` are omitted from this
summary.

Complex calculation workflows are organized by task and stage. The BSSE
workflow currently provides the preparation and postprocessing framework:

```text
abacustools workflow bsse prepare
abacustools workflow bsse postprocess
```

Charge-density difference calculations are available as `chgdiff`. Prepare
the full-system and two-subsystem SCF jobs, submit them with
`sbatch runabacus.sh`, and then generate the difference cube:

```text
abacustools workflow chgdiff prepare -j JOB -i 1 3 4
abacustools workflow chgdiff postprocess -j JOB
```

Elastic constants can be calculated with the stress-strain workflow. It
generates one unstrained job and 24 independently strained jobs. By default,
the jobs use ionic relaxation at fixed cell shape; use `--norelax` for fixed-ion
SCF calculations:

```text
abacustools workflow elastic prepare -j JOB
sbatch runabacus.sh  # submit from each generated job directory
abacustools workflow elastic postprocess -j JOB
```

The fitted elastic tensor and Voigt moduli are written to
`elastic_results.json` under `JOB`.

Phonon spectra can be calculated with finite differences using Phonopy. The
prepare stage generates displaced supercell SCF jobs, and the postprocess
stage reads their forces to produce thermal properties, DOS, and a combined
dispersion/DOS plot:

```text
abacustools workflow phonon prepare -j JOB
abacustools workflow phonon postprocess -j JOB
```

Use `--supercell A B C` to set the supercell explicitly. Without it, the
supercell is selected so each lattice vector is at least 10 Angstrom long.
Custom paths can be passed as JSON with `--qpath` and
`--high-symm-points`.

Molecular vibration frequencies can be calculated with selected atoms using
central finite differences. The workflow writes equilibrium and displaced
force calculations below `vib/`:

```text
abacustools workflow vibration prepare -j JOB
abacustools workflow vibration postprocess -j JOB
```

Use `--index 1 2 ...` to select atoms and `--traj` to write mode trajectories.

Generated calculation directories are protected by default. Use `--override`
when intentionally replacing them. Submission scripts are intentionally not
generated because their contents depend on the target computing environment.

Each prepared workflow records its task names and atom partition in
`workflow.json`. Postprocessing validates this manifest and checks that the
required SCF calculations converged before reading their outputs.
